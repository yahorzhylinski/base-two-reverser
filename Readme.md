Task
----

 In base −2, integers are represented by sequences of bits in the following way. Sequence B of N bits represents the number: sum{ B[i]*(−2)^i for i = 0..N−1 }. The empty sequence represents 0. Note that such a representation is suitable for both positive and negative integers.

Write a function:

function solution($A);

that, given a zero-indexed array A of M bits, containing a sequence representing some integer X, returns the shortest sequence of bits representing −X.

The sequence should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given A = [1,0,0,1,1] (X = 9), the function should return [1,1,0,1] (−X = −9). Given A = [1,0,0,1,1,1] (X = −23), the function should return [1,1,0,1,0,1,1] (−X = 23).

Assume that:
- M is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
- each element of array A is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.

Complexity:
- expected worst-case time complexity is O(M);
- expected worst-case space complexity is O(M),
- beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
